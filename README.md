# Rdfind - redundant data find
This is a command line tool to find and optionally do something about
duplicate files.

The home for rdfind is currently (March 2018) moving to github: https://github.com/pauldreik/rdfind/

# Install
If your are on Debian or Ubuntu, your best option is probably to use the official package:
    apt install rdfind
